# The same but different: evidence for the co-evolution of language and toolmaking through neural re-use

This project is a **work in progress**.

## Results

- **Report:** [results/results.html](results/results.html) — view in a browser.
- **Source:** The HTML report is generated by knitting [results/results.Rmd](results/results.Rmd).

- **Manuscript figures:** The main figures used in the manuscripy are generated by knitting [results/manuscript_figures.Rmd](results/manuscript_figures.Rmd).

## Reproducing the analysis

[results/results.Rmd](results/results.Rmd) drives the analysis. When run, it sources R scripts from the [code/](code/) folder:

- `code/load_dependencies.R`
- `code/preprocess_data.R`
- `code/analysis_functions.R`
- `code/plotting_functions.R`
- `code/table_functions.R`

To reproduce: open `results/results.Rmd` in RStudio and knit, or from the project root run:

```r
rmarkdown::render("results/results.Rmd")
```

(Requires R and the `here` package; use the project root as working directory.)

Input data lives in [data/](data/).
